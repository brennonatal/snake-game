    next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    print(f'Step {i+1}: Action={action} ({env.actions[action]}), Reward={reward:.1f}')
    env.render()  # Show ASCII visualization
    if done:
        print('Episode ended!')
        break
"
```

#### Advanced Environment Configuration
```python
from snake_rl.environment import SnakeEnvironment, SnakeEnvironmentConfig

# Custom configuration
config = SnakeEnvironmentConfig(
    width=300,           # Smaller game board
    height=200,          # Smaller game board  
    cell_size=10,        # Cell size in pixels
    headless=False,      # Enable ASCII rendering
    max_steps=500        # Maximum steps per episode
)

# Create environment with custom settings
env = config.create_environment()

# Test the environment
state = env.reset()
print(f"Grid size: {env.grid_width}x{env.grid_height}")
print(f"State size: {env.state_size}")

# Run episode with visualization
total_reward = 0
steps = 0

while True:
    # Random action for testing
    action = np.random.randint(0, 4)
    
    next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    total_reward += reward
    steps += 1
    
    # Show progress every 10 steps
    if steps % 10 == 0:
        env.render()
        print(f"Steps: {steps}, Total Reward: {total_reward:.1f}")
    
    if done:
        print(f"Episode finished! Steps: {steps}, Total Reward: {total_reward:.1f}")
        print(f"Final info: {info}")
        break
```

## 🧠 RL Environment Details

### State Representation
The RL environment uses a **grid-based state representation**:
- **Grid Size**: 60×40 (600×400 pixels ÷ 10 pixel cells)
- **State Encoding**:
  - `0`: Empty space
  - `1`: Snake head  
  - `2`: Snake body
  - `3`: Food
- **State Shape**: `(2400,)` - flattened grid for ML algorithms

### Action Space
4 discrete actions with intelligent collision prevention:
- `0`: UP - Move snake head up  
- `1`: DOWN - Move snake head down
- `2`: LEFT - Move snake head left
- `3`: RIGHT - Move snake head right

**Smart Action Handling**: The environment prevents immediate death by ignoring actions that would make the snake move into its own body.

### Reward System
The reward system implements a carefully designed structure to guide the agent towards optimal behavior:

**Primary Rewards (High Impact):**
- **Food eaten**: +100 (large positive reinforcement for achieving the goal)
- **Wall collision**: -100 (terminal penalty for hitting boundaries)  
- **Self collision**: -100 (terminal penalty for hitting snake body)
- **Max steps reached**: -50 (efficiency penalty for taking too long)

**Secondary Rewards (Behavior Shaping):**
- **Moving closer to food**: +10 (stronger guidance towards food)
- **Moving away from food**: -5 (discouragement for moving in wrong direction)
- **Survival bonus**: +1 per step (encourages staying alive and exploring)
- **Length bonus**: +2 per snake segment (rewards growth and longer games)

**Reward Design Principles:**
- **Sparse primary rewards** create clear objectives (food/death)
- **Dense shaping rewards** provide continuous learning signals
- **Distance-based guidance** helps with exploration in large state space
- **Progressive bonuses** encourage longer, more successful episodes

#### Testing the Reward System
```python
from snake_rl.environment import SnakeEnvironment
import numpy as np

# Create environment with debug logging
env = SnakeEnvironment(headless=True)

# Test reward components
state = env.reset()
total_reward = 0

for step in range(100):
    action = np.random.randint(0, 4)
    next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    total_reward += reward
    
    # Monitor reward patterns
    print(f"Step {step}: Action={env.actions[action]}, Reward={reward:.1f}, Status={info['status']}")
    
    if done:
        print(f"Episode ended: Total reward={total_reward:.1f}, Score={info.get('score', 0)}")
        break
```

#### Reward Debugging Tips
- **Enable DEBUG logging** to see detailed reward component breakdowns
- **Monitor distance changes** to verify guidance rewards work correctly
- **Test edge cases** like immediate collisions or long survival episodes
- **Analyze reward distribution** across different game scenarios

### Environment API

#### Core Methods
```python
# Standard RL Environment Interface
state = env.reset()                    # Reset to initial state
state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)  # Take action
env.render(mode="human")               # Visualize current state

# Additional Utilities  
valid_actions = env.get_valid_actions()  # Get valid actions
config = SnakeEnvironmentConfig(...)     # Configure environment
```

#### State and Action Information
```python
# Environment properties
print(f"Grid dimensions: {env.grid_width}x{env.grid_height}")
print(f"State size: {env.state_size}")
print(f"Action space: {env.action_space}")
print(f"Action mapping: {env.actions}")

# Game state information (from info dict)
info = {
    'status': 'playing',              # Game status
    'steps': 42,                      # Steps taken this episode
    'snake_length': 3,                # Current snake length
    'food_position': (100, 200),      # Food location (x, y)
    'head_position': (50, 150)        # Snake head location (x, y)
}
```

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

### SnakeEnvironmentConfig Options
```python
config = SnakeEnvironmentConfig(
    width=600,          # Game board width in pixels (default: 600)
    height=400,         # Game board height in pixels (default: 400)  
    cell_size=10,       # Size of each cell in pixels (default: 10)
    headless=True,      # Disable rendering for faster training (default: True)
    max_steps=1000      # Maximum steps per episode (default: 1000)
)
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Headless Mode**: Set `headless=True` for maximum training speed (50,000+ steps/sec)
- **Custom Grid Size**: Smaller grids train faster but may reduce state complexity
- **Max Steps**: Limit episode length to prevent infinite episodes

config = get_default_config("tabular")
agent = TabularQAgent(
    state_size=env.state_size,
    learning_rate=config.learning_rate,
    epsilon=config.epsilon_start,

```

### Advanced Tabular Q-Learning Training
```python
from snake_rl import QLearningConfig, get_preset_config

# Use preset configurations
config = get_preset_config("tabular_fast")  # or "tabular_stable"

# Or create custom configuration
config = QLearningConfig(
    learning_rate=0.15,          # Higher learning rate for faster adaptation
    epsilon_start=1.0,           # Start with full exploration
    epsilon_end=0.05,            # End with some exploration
    epsilon_decay=0.998,         # Gradual decay
    max_episodes=8000,           # Training episodes
    eval_frequency=200,          # Evaluate every 200 episodes
    save_frequency=1000          # Save checkpoints every 1000 episodes
)

# Create environment and agent
env = SnakeEnvironment(
    width=600, height=400,       # Standard game size
    headless=True,               # No visualization for speed
    max_steps=1000               # Episode timeout
)

agent = TabularQAgent(
    state_size=env.state_size,   # 2400 (60x40 grid)
    action_size=4,               # UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT

    discount_factor=config.discount_factor,
    epsilon=config.epsilon_start,
    epsilon_min=config.epsilon_end,
    epsilon_decay=config.epsilon_decay
)

agent.save("checkpoints/tabular_agent_final.pkl")

# Load and evaluate pre-trained model
agent = TabularQAgent(state_size=2400, action_size=4)
agent.load("checkpoints/tabular_agent_final.pkl")

# Test the trained agent
env = SnakeEnvironment(headless=False)  # Enable visualization
state = env.reset()
total_reward = 0

while True:
    action = agent.get_action(state)  # Agent chooses action
    state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    total_reward += reward
    env.render()  # Show the game
    
    if done:
        print(f"Game Over! Score: {info['score']}, Total Reward: {total_reward:.1f}")
        break
```

### Deep Q-Network Training
```python
from snake_rl import DQNAgent, DQNConfig

# Create DQN configuration
config = DQNConfig(
    hidden_layers=[512, 256, 128],  # Network architecture
    learning_rate=0.001,            # Adam optimizer learning rate
    buffer_size=15000,              # Experience replay buffer
    batch_size=64,                  # Training batch size
    target_update_frequency=1000,   # Target network update interval
    max_episodes=10000              # Training episodes
)

# Create agent
agent = DQNAgent(
    state_size=env.state_size,
    learning_rate=config.learning_rate,
    buffer_size=config.buffer_size,
    batch_size=config.batch_size,

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'game_engine'`
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd snake-game
python -c "from snake_rl.environment import SnakeEnvironment"
```

**Performance Issues**: Environment running slowly
```python
# Use headless mode for training
env = SnakeEnvironment(headless=True)  # No ASCII rendering
```

**State Shape Confusion**: 
```python
# State is flattened grid: (2400,) = 60 * 40
state = env.reset()
grid = state.reshape(40, 60)  # Reshape to 2D if needed
```

### Debug Logging

Enable detailed logging to debug reward system and training:

```python
import logging

# Enable debug logging for the environment
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger('snake_rl.environment')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# This will show detailed reward component breakdowns
env = SnakeEnvironment(headless=True)
```

**Example Debug Output:**
```
DEBUG:snake_rl.environment:Reward components: distance_reward=10.0, survival_bonus=1.0, length_bonus=4.0, Total: 15.0
DEBUG:snake_rl.environment:Food eaten reward: +100
DEBUG:snake_rl.environment:Reward components: food_reward=100.0, survival_bonus=1.0, length_bonus=6.0, Total: 107.0
```
